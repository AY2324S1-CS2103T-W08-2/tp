## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`,
`GradedComponentListPanel`, `StudentScoreListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts 
of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`, `GradedComponent` and `StudentScore`objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deleteStu 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ModuLightParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteStudentCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

**Note:** There are three different model objects, namely the StudentBook, the StudentScoreBook and the GradedComponentBook.
The command might interact with one or more model objects. For example, when a student is deleted, the command will communicate 
with the StudentBook to delete this student, as well as the StudentScoreBook, to delete all the student scores relevant to this student.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModuLightParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ModuLightParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

Note that Student, StudentGrade and GradeComponent classes have similar structures and dependencies, thus, we use Ssc class to represent these three and their related classes in the class diagram above.

Here are the class diagrams for Ssc (Student, StudentGrade, GradedComponent) classes respectively.
<puml src="diagrams/StudentModelDiagram.puml" width="450" /> <br>
<puml src="diagrams/StudentScoreModelDiagram.puml" width="300" />
<puml src="diagrams/GradedComponentModelDiagram.puml" width="300" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the ModuLight data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object), all `StudentScore` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentScoreList` object) and all `GradedComponent` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGradedComponentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student`, `StudentScore` and `GradedComponent` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists respectively which are exposed to outsiders as unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>`, `ObservableList<StudentScore>` and `ObservableList<GradedComponent>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** For student and student score, an alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Student`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save student data, student score data, graded component data and user preference data in JSON format, and read 
  them back into the corresponding objects.  
* inherits from `StudentBookStorage`, `GradedComponentBookStorage`, `StudentScoreBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`,
  which means it can be treated as any of the one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.modulight.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Auto-grading

#### Proposed Implementation

{Intro}

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Autograding mechanism for percentile calculation behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launch the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user creates the desired graded components and adds all the students in the cohort.

Step 3. The user then executes `autograde ag/percentile pg/5 15 30 50 60 70 80 90 95` to execute the auto-grading system, the 'percentile'
keyword indicates that ModuLight grades based on the students' percentile compared to another. The value after `pg/` indicates
the top percentile for each corresponding grade threshold, i.e. `pg/[A+] [A] [A-] [B+] ...`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The value for `ag/` can be type `score` which determines the grade based on the passing score of the student's total score.

</box>

Step 4. The command execution will then parse the grade threshold value based on empty space and stores them locally.
Then, it will call `Model#getStudentBook()` and will calculate for every student, what tag the student will get based on the
total score. ModuLight will then execute `editStudentCommand` on every student to assign them with the grade tag. All the calculations will be run in the
`autoGradeCommand`.



#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the assignments of grade works:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use tags to assign the grade
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Not ideal if we want to extend the code for more features.
* **Alternative 2:** Create new Grade object for each student.
    * Pros: Cleaner and extendable code implementation.
    * Cons: require change of implementation on multiple classes.



### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

Since `Student`, `StudentGrade` and `GradedComponent` have similar dependencies and behavior, we will use `Ssc` to refer these three classes and their related classes in the following discussion. In other words, `VersionedSscBook` means `VersionedStudentBook`, `VersionedStudentScoreBook` and `VersionedGradedComponentBook`.
The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedSscBook`. It extends `SscBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `sscStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedSscBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current ssc book state in its history.
* `VersionedSscBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous ssc book state from its history.
* `VersionedSscBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone ssc book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitSscBook()`, `Model#undoSscBook()` and `Model#redoSscBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedSscBook` will be initialized with the initial Ssc book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Ssc book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `deleteStu 5` command to delete the 5th student in the Ssc book. The `deleteStu` command calls `Model#commitSscBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `SscBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Ssc book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `addStu n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `addStu` command also calls `Model#commitSscBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `sscBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitSscBook()`, so the ssc book state will not be saved into the `sscBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoSscBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous ssc book state, and restores the ssc book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial SscBook state, then there are no previous SscBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoSscBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoSscBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the ssc book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `sscBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone SscBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoSscBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `listAll`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitSscBook()`, `Model#undoSscBook()` or `Model#redoSscBook()`. Thus, the `sscBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clearAll`, which calls `Model#commitSscBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `sscBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire ssc book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteStu`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**

NUS professors who:
* have a need to manage a significant number of students and assessments in a single module
* are beginners to intermediate in spreadsheet technology
* prefer typing over interacting with the GUI with the mouse
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
* NUS professors need a convenient system to manage students and assessments. We propose a program to track students and their performance on graded components, utility functions to get statistics on the cohort and certain subgroups, ability to tag students (eg. dropped module, potential TA etc.), alongside general GUI improvements.
